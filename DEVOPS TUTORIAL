QUE: What is devopS? 
ANS: Devops is like bridge between software development and it oprations 
its  all about making process of building ,testing and deploying software faster ,more reliable and efficient 
by fostering collaboration and automation between development and operation teams.

QUE: What is Devops life cycle?
ANS:      The devops lifecycle is a continuous software development process that employes devops bestt practices to plan , build ,test , deploy , monitor , oprate and Code offer 
continuous feedback throughout the software lifecycle .
1) DISCOVER 
       In the Discover phase, a DevOps team researches and defines the scope of a project. 
In particular, it involves activities such as user research, establishing goals, and defining success.
Tools like Mural and Miro empower the entire software team to gather ideas and conduct research. 
Jira Product Discovery organizes this information into actionable inputs and prioritizes actions for development teams. 
As you’re prioritizing, you’ll also need to keep your backlog of user feedback in mind.
Product discovery is the very first activity of a product design, which then becomes the baseline for decision making. 
During product discovery, you can collect all the crucial information about any user problems and then provide solutions for them.
We recommend looking for tools that encourage “asynchronous brainstorming”. 
It’s important that everyone can share and comment on anything: ideas, strategies, goals, requirements, roadmaps, and documentation.

2)BUILD :
          Code will be introduced to the project during the construction phase, and if necessary, the project will be rebuilt to accommodate the new code. 
This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, although GitHub or a comparable version control site is frequently used.
The developer will request the addition of the code, which will then be reviewed as necessary. 
The request will be approved if the code is ready to be uploaded, and the code will be added to the project. 
Even when adding new features and addressing bugs, this method is effective.

3)TEST :
           Throughout the testing phase, teams will do any necessary testing to ensure the project performs as planned. 
Teams will also test for edge and corner case issues at this stage. 
An “edge case” is a bug or issue that only manifests during an extreme operating event, whereas a “corner case” occurs when many circumstances are met.

4)DEPOLY :
           In the deploy phase, the project is prepared for the production environment and is operating as planned in that environment. 
This would be the responsibility of the operations team; in DevOps, it is a shared responsibility. 
This shared duty pushes team members to collaborate to guarantee a successful deployment.

5)Operate :
          In the operating phase, teams test the project in a production environment, and end users utilise the product. 
This crucial stage is by no means the final step. Rather, it informs future development cycles and manages the configuration of the production environment and the implementation
of any runtime requirements.

6)Monitor : 
         During the monitoring phase, product usage, as well as any feedback, issues, or possibilities for improvement, are recognized and documented. 
This information is then conveyed to the subsequent iteration to aid in the development process. 
This phase is essential for planning the next iteration and streamlines the pipeline’s development process.

7) code :
       The developers will write the code and prepare it for the next phase during the coding stage. 
Developers will write code in accordance with the specifications outlined in the planning phase and will ensure that the code is created with the project’s operations in mind.
